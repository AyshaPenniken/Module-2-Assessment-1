                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species native to China. It is well known for its distinctive black-and-white 
                        coat and is a symbol of wildlife conservation.</p>
                    <p>Pandas are large, with adults weighing between 70-100 kg. They have black patches around their eyes, ears, and on their limbs. 
                        Despite their classification as carnivores, they primarily feed on bamboo.</p>
                    <p>Pandas are herbivores, mainly consuming bamboo. They are solitary animals, with a territory that they mark to avoid other pandas. 
                        Despite their size and strength, they are relatively slow-moving.</p>
                    <p>Pandas live in temperate forests with dense bamboo growth. Bamboo makes up over 99% of their diet, though they occasionally eat 
                        other plants or small animals.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen N8, right next to the gemsbok.</p>
