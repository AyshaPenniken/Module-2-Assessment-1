                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species of the big cat family, found primarily in Asia. There are several subspecies, including the 
                        Siberian tiger and the Bengal tiger.</p>
                    <p>Tigers have a muscular build, orange fur with black stripes, and sharp claws and teeth. Adult males can weigh up to 300 kg. Their powerful 
                        physique is adapted for hunting and ambushing prey.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are carnivores and solitary hunters. They use their camouflage to stalk and ambush prey, which includes large herbivores like deer and 
                        wild boar.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are found in forests, grasslands, and mangroves across Asia. They primarily hunt large mammals and can also live near water sources, such 
                        as rivers and lakes</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the tigers at pen N6, right next to the restaurant Dine @The Zoo.</p>
