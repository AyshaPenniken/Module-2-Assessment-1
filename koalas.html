                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a marsupial native to eastern Australia. It is closely related to other marsupials 
                        like kangaroos and wombats. Koalas are famous for their distinctive appearance and are often associated with eucalyptus forests.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are medium-sized marsupials with thick, woolly fur, large ears, and a large nose. They are arboreal animals, spending most 
                        of their time in trees.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are herbivores that feed mainly on eucalyptus leaves, which provide them with the majority of their water and nutrients. They are largely solitary animals and are known for their low-energy lifestyle, 
                        spending most of their time sleeping in trees.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are found in eucalyptus forests and woodlands of eastern Australia.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E13, right next to the giraffes.</p>
