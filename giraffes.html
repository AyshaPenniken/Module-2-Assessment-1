                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is a large mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the tallest 
                        land animal, with males reaching heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet). Giraffes are divided into several subspecies, 
                        mainly based on geographic distribution.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are easily recognisable by their long necks and legs, along with their distinctive spotted coats. Their height, 
                        which can reach up to 5.5 meters (18 feet), helps them browse leaves from tall trees, particularly acacias.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees. They live in loose, fluid 
                        groups called herds, with no formal structure. Their long necks, while useful for feeding, are also employed in neckingâ€”a 
                        behavior used by males to establish dominance.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are found in savannahs, woodlands, and open forests across sub-Saharan Africa. They prefer areas with abundant 
                        trees for browsing. Their diet is primarily leaves from acacia trees, but they also eat fruit and shrubs.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E12, right next to the monkeys.</p>
