                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are primates divided into two suborders: New World monkeys (found in the Americas) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia). 
                        They are characterised by a wide variety of species, ranging from small, agile monkeys like marmosets to large, powerful ones like baboons.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys vary greatly in size and appearance, with most having long tails (except for apes), opposable thumbs, and agile limbs. Their fur ranges 
                        from light to dark, depending on the species.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are omnivorous, eating fruits, seeds, insects, and small animals. They are social creatures, often living in large groups. Their complex 
                        behaviors include using tools, vocalisations, and intricate social structures.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys inhabit a variety of ecosystems, including tropical forests, savannahs, and mountainous areas. They have varied diets based on their 
                        environment, with most species being opportunistic feeders.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
