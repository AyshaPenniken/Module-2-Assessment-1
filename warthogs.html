                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild pig species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is known for its large tusks and wart-like 
                        growths on its face.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs have a tough, hairy body with large tusks that protrude from the upper and lower jaws. Their skin is sparse, and they are 
                        relatively small compared to other wild pigs.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs are omnivores, feeding on grass, roots, fruits, and insects. They are social animals, living in groups called sounders. Warthogs 
                        use their tusks for defense and fighting.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs live in savannahs, woodlands, and grasslands across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen N10, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
