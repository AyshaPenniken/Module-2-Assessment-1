                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous mammal found in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of India. Lions are the only species of the big 
                        cat family that live in social groups called prides.</p>
                    <p>Lions have muscular bodies, a large head, and a mane (in males), which distinguishes them from other big cats. Adult males can weigh up to 
                        250 kg, while females are typically smaller. Lions have sharp claws and powerful jaws for hunting and defending their pride.</p>
                    <p>Lions are carnivores and often hunt in groups. Males protect the pride, while females do the majority of hunting. Lions use a variety of 
                        vocalisations, including roars, to communicate and establish territory.</p>
                    <p>Lions are primarily found in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their diet consists mainly of large herbivores like zebras and 
                        wildebeests, though they also scavenge when opportunities arise.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the lions at pen E13, opposite the elephants.</p>
