                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope from southern Africa, belonging to the genus Oryx and the family Bovidae. It is primarily found
                        in Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and Angola. The gemsbok is closely related to the scimitar-horned oryx, which is now extinct in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are robust with a light gray to tan coat, white underparts, and black facial and leg markings. They have long, straight horns that can
                         grow up to 1 meter (3.3 feet), present in both males and females. Males weigh 200â€“240 kg, and females are slightly smaller. Their strong build 
                         is well-suited for desert survival.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are herbivores, feeding on grasses and shrubs. They can survive in extreme heat and can go long periods without water. They live in herds
                         led by females, with males often solitary. Their horns are used for defense against predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are found in arid regions like the Kalahari Desert and scrublands of southern Africa. They prefer areas with sparse vegetation but access
                         to temporary water sources. Their diet mainly consists of grass and shrubs, and they are highly adaptable to dry conditionS.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen N7, right next to the pandas.</p>
