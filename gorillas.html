                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>The gorilla is the largest living primate, native to the forests of central Africa. There are two species: the western gorilla 
                        and the eastern gorilla, each with two subspecies. Gorillas are closely related to humans, sharing around 98% of our DNA.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas have large, powerful bodies, with males typically weighing between 140-200 kg. They have black or dark brown fur, broad chests, and large 
                        hands. The silverback male, distinguished by the silvery fur on his back.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are herbivorous and primarily eat leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. They are social animals, living in groups led by a dominant 
                        silverback male. Gorillas communicate through vocalisations, body language, and facial expressions.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas live in dense forests, particularly in the lowland and mountain regions of central Africa. Their diet is composed of plant material such 
                        as leaves, fruit, and bamboo shoots, with occasional consumption of insects.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
